    <h1>W03_robots</h1>

    <p>This page tests that Amber respects robots.txt files which disallow the Amber Bot user agent string. The following link is on a server which has this in robots.txt:</p>

    <pre>user-agent: Amber
disallow: /</pre>

    <a href="http://surii.net/Settings/">http://surii.net/Settings/</a>

    <p>This link should not be preserved because it's disallowed by robots.txt.</p>

    <h1>W03_normal / F01</h1>

    <p>This page tests that Amber can cache a page that is not blocked, excluded and always up.</p>


    <a href="http://amberlink.org/fetcher/">http://amberlink.org/fetcher/</a>

    <p>This link should be preserved because there is nothing telling Amber not to.</p>

    <p>It is also testing F01 because the preserved link should be available through the Amber popup on the link above.</p>

    <p>Also testing issue <span data-issue="11806">#11806</span>.</p>
